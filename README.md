# MT32-DIT
<h3>Adding digital output to legendary Roland MT-32</h3>
<p>
This project can be considered part #2 of the digitalization of old synthesizers. In the first part I described <a href="https://github.com/vetal-esher/18bit-DIT">how you can add a  digital outpu</a>t to almost any synthesizer (where the DAC circuit uses standard L/R combined I2S) by using the AK4103AVF</p>

<p>
Roland MT-32, familiar to old gamers in the 90s and very rare now, is an even older device that uses a parallel DAC scheme that was 
quite common in Roland's D-series, which does not just convert the final stereo stream in-line, but also simultaneously performs 
the services of a DAC for the reverb IC.</p>

<h3>Digging demuxer logic</h4>

<p><img src="images/mt32-4051.jpg"></p>

<p>
It turns out that we do not have direct access to the digital stream containing the final audio data. The PCM54HP receives a stream 
that sequentially contains not only clean left and right channels, but also separate reverb data for the left and right channels. 
It looks something like this (all frames are 16bit, order is assumed): [RSYN1][LSYN1][REV R][REV L][RSYN2][LSYN2][RSYN1][LSYN1][REV R][REV L][RSYN2] [LSYN2] etc.</p>
<p>
The advantage of a parallel DAC is that it works instantly, i.e. there is no delay at all in taking the current values 
from the (essentially) resistor assembly and the next moment doing the task of transforming a completely different picture. <strong>Edit: 
to tell the truth, there IS small delay required to let the output settled the final value.</strong>
</p>
<p>The widely known CD4051 is engaged in demultiplexing all this porridge of audio data. Channel switching in the CD4051 is carried out 
through the control lines mixed from LA and Reverb chips SH1 SH2 SH2 (SH - Sample / Hold), as well as the INH line, which turns on and off 
all channels. At the output of the demuxer, three pairs of analog channels are formed, which are then mixed and undergo final 
processing in a low-pass filter. The LP filter should have a flat amplitude response in the 0-20kHz range and a high attenuation above 20kHz.

<p>
Bit depth and sampling frequency of MT-32 according to the declared characteristics - 15bit 32kHz. In the first version of MT-32 
(the so-called "old"), the last (actually, LSB) 16th bit at the PCM54HP input is shorted to ground, and for that (15bit) reason the 14th bit fell out 
in the data bus itself (counting from zero). However, for us, the frame width will always be 16 bits (the 2nd MT-32 version has full 16bit bus). Theoretically, the channel  switching frequency 0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7 each time triggers a 0/1 state change in control signal A, so you can 
expect 128kHz on this line,  64kHz on line B, and C with 32kHz respectively. But we don't know the order of the frames. Even if we 
sequentially record all the states of the parallel bus, it will be useless if we do not know the order of switching ABC. In practice, 
without a three-channel oscilloscope, you can try to catch the states of at least two of the three lines (A and C), and then record 
the AB and BC, A and INH sequences in order to further bring the picture into one.
</p>
<p><img src="images/INH-A-B-C.png"></p>
<p>

So now we know the frame order: [L REV][RSYN2][LSYN2][R REV][RSYN1][LSYN1], [L REV][RSYN2][LSYN2][R REV][RSYN1][LSYN1] .. etc. 
If you listen to these pins in analog, it becomes clear that SYN1 is a clean signal, REV is a reverb return. SYN2 appears to be 
analog as well, but too quiet to be recorded legibly; but since SYN2 is also mixed into the final mix, we'll do that too. 
By the way, if you look at the unused outputs of the CD4051 CH4 and CH5, there will be [almost] crisp 32kHz:

<p float="left"><img src="images/CH4.png" width="50%"><img src="images/CH5.png" width="50%"></p>

<p>The INH control signal operates at a frequency of 256kHz, which means we will need to read all ports at this frequency. 
Disabling all channels is necessary so that there is no false triggering on rising edges @ABC states, when INH=1 tells us that 
we donâ€™t need to send anything to serial. With INH=0, we must read the bus, and depending on the states of ABC, scatter it to 
the appropriate output. Ideally, we need to define the beginning of frame (we take the highest INH peak for the reference frame)
and mix all L / R frames into two final ones. But for the test, you can start by sending two frames with a clean non-reverberated 
information (RSYN1, LSYN1). At first I thought to bother with the sequence' start detection, but then I omitted this part, because,
even if the logic begins to run in the middle, defining LSYN1 as the end of the sequence we will reset the counters and then start 
working in the correct order. The logic in this case will look something like this (I will use a pseudo-language here with a syntax 
that is clear to everyone):</p>

<pre>
(R,L)=(0,0);
(FLAG_RSYN1,FLAG_LSYN1,FLAG_RSYN2,FLAG_LSYN2,FLAG_RREV,FLAG_LREV)=(0,0,0,0,0,0);
(RSYN1,LSYN1,RSYN2,LSYN2,RREV,LREV)=(0,0,0,0,0,0);
while (256kHz_cycle) {
	input=read(PCM54_parallel);
	A=read(CD4051_A); B=read(CD4051_B); C=read(CD4051_C); INH=read(CD4051_INH);

	#INH==0 enables output
	if (INH==0) {
		if (A==1 && B==1 && C==0) {
			RSYN2=input; FLAG_RSYN2=1; #RSYN2
		}
		elsif (A==0 && B==1 && C==0) {
			LSYN2=input; FLAG_LSYN2=1; #LSYN2
		}

			(FLAG_RSYN1,FLAG_LSYN1,FLAG_RSYN2,FLAG_LSYN2,FLAG_RREV,FLAG_LREV)=(1,1,1,1,1,1);
		}

		if (FLAG_RSYN1==1 && FLAG_LSYN1==1 && FLAG_RSYN2==1 && FLAG_LSYN2==1 && FLAG_RREV==1 && FLAG_LREV==1) {

<h3>Hardware part</h3>

<p>Schematically, the plan of the entire project was drawn like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/profit.png"></p>
<p>
There is only one magic figure involved in this plan, and here, I will honestly say, giant constructions of logic which must perform the task of mixing digital streams comes to mind. I was told that I should stop doing garbage and learn a programmable FPGA. All of the DAC and INH/A/B/C signals are CMOS-level, so we need to convert them to TTL by CD4050B. By the way, we will get fixed levels of INH after CD4050:
</p>
<p><img src="images/after4050.png"></p>
<h4>DIT</h4>
<p>
Since we are dealing with 16 bits, a large number of DITs can be used, as they all work at least with 16-bit RJ. For these purposes, I chose DIT4192, because I have it  already available after experimenting with the 18-bit DIT, but you can skip mounting 4192 if you don't have it (details below). Settings are typical:
<table border="1">
<tr><th colspan="2">DIT4192 Hardware mode</th></tr>
<tr><td>Mode operation</td><td>Slave (SYNC and SCLK are inputs)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Format</td><td>16-Bit Right-Justified</td></tr>

<tr><td>Bit clock</td><td>1.024MHz (16*2*32KHz)</td></tr>
</table>
</p>

<h3>Magic part</h3>
<p>The FPGA <a href="https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/tang/Tang-Nano-9K/Nano-9K.html">TangNano9K</a> was chosen for the magic part, so the "profit" plan was drawn:</p>
<p><img src="images/profit2.png"></p>
<p>And then the complete schematic of the "magic" part was done. Note the I2S connector, you can completely skip DIT4192 in schematic and use your favorite external DIT, or even just transport I2S to I2S receiver. I tested I2S with external WM8804 DIT board and it works perfectly.</p>
<p><img src="images/9k-schematic.png"></p>

<h3>Making prototypes</h3>
<p>I started with sandwich-like breadboard, trying to split the CMOS-TTL logic from TangNano. Different methods, using couple of variants (voltage dividers) and CD4050 were tried..</p>
<p float="left"><img src="images/proto1.jpg" width="50%"><img src="images/proto2.jpg" width="50%"></p>

.. and then, when i finally decided to use CD4050, i have projected the PCB. The PCBs were made quick at PCBway factory, and i must say their quality is awesome, even for such pet projects like mine :) 

<p float="left"><img src="images/pcbway1.jpg" width="50%"><img src="images/pcbway2.jpg" width="50%"></p>

<p>Final design assumes, that the original PCM54HP will be desoldered from MT-32 mainboard, and then socketed on second footprint right on DIT pcb. After that, MT32-DIT can be soldered or socketed on MT-32 mainboard. But for now, we'll just put on the DIT board right over PCM54HP IC.</p>

<h3>Learning VERILOG</h3>

The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIkrG32c1l0">first video</a> of clean capture (sorry for low volume, it was at night) (clean stereo, no reverb).

<h3>Mixing 6 digital channels to stereo pair</h3>

The simplest logic of audio mixing is summing the levels. This works in digital too. Remember, that actual bitwidth of "old" Roland MT-32 is 15 (LSB bit is tied to the GND. So, we can use 17-bit buffer to sum all 3 channels and then divide them by 2 (simple bitshift). Also i implemented "reverb on/off" switch tied to second button at TangNano9K devboard (first one is RESET button).

<h3>Solving clicks problem</h3>
<p>I found that the frequency of DTR (the flag that signals about full frame cycle pass) is slightly faster than WCLK (smth about 32.0010kHz@DTR vs exact 32.0000kHz@WCLK). It may (and will) produce small clicks in the audio stream about every 32000 ticks of DTR.</p>

<p><img src="images/clicks.png"></p>

<p>Even worse: there <strong>might be</strong> desync that can produce more clicks than useful audio data. </p>
<p float="left"><img src="images/clicks02.png" width="50%"><img src="images/clicks03.png" width="50%"></p>

<p>So the logic need some sync correction (FIFO or whatever).</p>


<p><strong>to be continued..</strong></p>

<h2>Mounting</h2>

<strong>Bad contact problem.</strong> It was nightmare to spend hours to find the source of noisy sound. After weeks(!) of resultless tries, i found that the way i put the pcb over original DAC is not reliable at all - some pins was not connected . 

<p><strong><a href="audio/clean.mp3">Example of clean sound.</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>And <a href="audio/dirty_1.mp3">this is what you should hear</a> when some bits are not connected</strong></p>

<p>To avoid bad contact problem, the only way is to desolder DAC and socket it on the MT32-DIT pcb. This process is very hard without proper experience. First of all, you need to replace nearby caps with lower profile equivalents. Film caps are perfectly fit this objective. Then desolder the DAC itself.</p>

<p>While replacing the caps, it is time to think about picking A/B/C/INH directly from CD4051 demuxer. When you solder wires directly to DIP-package pins, wires tend to break when they bend, so i decided to solder a small protoboard over CD4051 for easy access to this signals.

<p>I used PBD (2-row) 2.54 female headers for socketing the DIT pcb in DAC place. One row, of course, needs to be removed. Why 2-row? Just because i had much more PBD headers than PBS. You can use PBS if you want. Then socket the PCM54HP on DIT pcb.</p>

<p>Remove the MT-32 board from the case. It's time to drill a hole and mount RCA. Find the place where you want it.</p>
